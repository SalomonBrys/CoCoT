The Concurrent Compiler Toolkit is a research project by Salomon BRYS at the University of Kent Canterbury.
It aims to provide developers a way to easily create very fast multi-pass compilers by parallelizing each pass (Lexer, Parser, AST Verifications, AST Optimizations, Code Generation).
CoCoT provides:
A specific extended BNF that integrates concurrent parsing.
A lexer and parser that can work concurrently.
A specific AST builder, AST analyzer and code generator toolkit that is optimized for concurrent use and may or may not be used.
A makefile-like toolkit that can be used to parallelize each pass on multiple files compilation.
